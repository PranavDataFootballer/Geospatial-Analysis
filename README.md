# Geospatial-Analysis
This project aims to provide insights into the spatial distribution, density, and clustering patterns of restaurants within the city. By leveraging geospatial data and analytical techniques, this project helps identify trends such as popular dining areas, underserved regions, and the relationship between restaurant locations and other factors like demographics or accessibility.

The main objectives of this project are:

1) Understand Restaurant Distribution: Identify which neighborhoods have a high concentration of restaurants and which are underrepresented.
2) Explore Restaurant Diversity: Investigate the variety of restaurant types and their spatial relationships.

Tools and Technologies used:-
1) Geopandas and Shapely for geospatial data processing and analysis.
2) Folium and Matplotlib for visualization and interactive mapping.
3) Scikit-learn for clustering analysis.
4) QGIS or ArcGIS for advanced geospatial operations and visualization.
